Revision history for Perl extension Apache::MP3.
2.14 Sat Dec 30 23:10:32 EST 2000
	- Fixed documentation to indicate that AddType requires dots before the
		.mp3 and .MP3 extension names.
	- Made the cache writing taint safe.
	- Fixed generation of extended playlists to work with earlier versions
		of WinAmp.
	- Added playlist and local streaming patches kindly provided by
		Jamie O'Shaughnessy.
	- Fixed display of directory path links when the current directory has same
		name as a parent directory.

2.13 Thu Nov 30 12:17:31 EST 2000
	- Patch from Jeffrey Sumler to prevent faults when streaming files containing
		regular expression metacharacters
	- Fix to prevent entire directory from being streamed when the directory
		has same name as the desired MP3 file (Jeffrey Sumler identified problem).

2.12 Tue Nov 21 08:39:15 EST 2000
	** IMPORTANT NOTE **
	I have normalized field names and added some new fields.  In particular, "kbps" has
	been renamed "bitrate".  If you are using the mp3info caching feature, please delete 
	your cache directory so that the new fields are correctly cached

	-Check for invalid songs in playlist and refuse to play them.
	-Added Jeffrey Seifert's patch for cover art.  You can now place a file named
		"cover.jpg" in an album subdirectory and have it appear next to
		the album's name.
	-Added Chris Nandor's patch for Accept-Range so that certain players can
		fetch selected portions of the song (in theory at least).
	-Added Kee Hinkley's extended playlist patch, which allows WinAmp (and other players?)
		to display the title and duration of the song in the playlist.
	-Added Gary Johnston's patch which fixes truncated songs when streaming from a
		Windows server (the old binmode() trap).

2.11 Sat Sep  9 18:04:55 EDT 2000
	Added Tim Ayer's patches for sorting.  Now can sort playlists 
		on multiple fields (nice!)
	Detect when playlist cookie is full, alert user, and suppress 
		further attempts to add to playlist.
	Documentation fixes.

2.10 Sun Sep  3 20:29:41 MET DST 2000
	Ooops.  Playlist.pm was inadvertently left out; now it's back in.
	Fixed divide by zero error on corrupt MP3 files.

2.08 Wed Aug 30 22:39:38 EDT 2000
	Added playlist functionality.
	Temporarily changed form POST method to GET to work around an (apparent) bug
		in mod_perl's ability to redirect from a POST to a GET (Apache hangs
		after returning from handler).  It "used to work" just fine.
	Suppressed appearance of authentication information
		XMMS/WinAmp scrolling marquee

2.07 Sat Aug 26 13:49:30 EDT 2000
	Fixed caching routines so that information about failed mp3_info()
		lookups is cached as well.

2.06 Fri Aug 25 23:39:00 EDT 2000
	Fixed bug in [stream] button that caused module to fail on
		directories containing parentheses and other RE
		metacharacters
